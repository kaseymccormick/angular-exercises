# Foundation Baseline

### For your information

     - Ngrx, bootstrap and angular cli are already installed
     - There is no terminal or git here, so to create a component or similar right click on the folder you want to
      create one in.
      angular generator > component
     -
      Font sizes do not need to be same, pixel perfect not required. use h tags
      and bootstrap grid to align things

     - Icons are from font awsome

         - user
         - bell
         - circle check
         - times circle


     - This is testing component naming, placement and use as well as state managment, google chops and using your
      resources. (For this situation Sr Devs are not a resource, this is not realistic for everyday work.)

     - There are colors provided for success, error, and info as well as a adequate dark and light gray. With some
      text-color classes added. Check styles.scss chances are what you need is there.
     - I will be doing this exercise too, it is only fair.
     - We will talk through what we did breifly and use this information for when we refactor components. Starting
      March 16th

#### What you're supposed to do

     - Recreate the interaction using

         - [mockup 1 user](https://github.com/kaseymccormick/angular-exercises/blob/main/foundation-baseline/admin-view.svg)
         - [mockup 2
            admin](https://github.com/kaseymccormick/angular-exercises/blob/main/foundation-baseline/user-view.svg)


     - clicking user must show user view and change headline
     - clicking admin must show admin view and change headline
     -
      do this in responsible amount of components, code should be minimaly copied.
      Meaning there shouldn't just be three components for this.

     - state manage the click count of checkmark(increase) and x(decrease) on a favorite color, emulating a voting
      system
      here.

         - # is a placeholder for the state managed voted number


     - use bootstraps card system with header and footer, as well as bootstrap buttons.
     - share button should be disabled
     - when you click add button have an bootstrap danger alert show up saying Sorry, not available <b>yet</b>
     - time yourself, use toggle, stopwatch paper and pen I don't care. try and get within 15 minutes of reality.

         - I'm not 'grading' on timing, knowing where the struggle is helps.
         - you knowing how long a task takes you helps
         - I'd break up timing into <ol>
             - planning
             - component creation/ file setup
             - state management
             - cleanup : checking files for console.logs, comented out code, making coments for fellow team members,
              adding link to your stackblitz to your ticket & updating ticket
          </ol>
